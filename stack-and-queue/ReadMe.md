# Singly Linked List

## Challenge

Create a Linked List + node class + Stack + Queue


## Approach & Efficiency
 Method | Space | Time
 --------stack--------
 pop  | O(n) | O(1)
 push | O(n) | O(1)
-------queue---------
enqueue| O(n) | O(1)
dequeue| O(n) | O(1)
## API
**stack**:
pop : Removes the node from the top of the stack
push : adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time
**queue**
enqueue : adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1)
dequeue : Removes the node from the front of the queue
> peek : Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue
